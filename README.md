# miniWeatherML

Welcome to miniWeatherML: A playground for learning and developing Machine Learning (ML) surrogate models and workflows. It is based on weather-like flows such as [supercells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercell) that are realistic enough to be challenging and small enough for rapid prototyping in:
* Data generation and curation
* Machine Learning model training
* ML model deployment and analysis
* End-to-end workflows
