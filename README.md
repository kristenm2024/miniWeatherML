Welcome to miniWeatherML, a playground for learning and developing Machine Learning (ML) surrogate models. It is realistic enough to be challenging and small enough for rapid prototyping in:
* Data generation and curation
* Machine Learning model training
* ML model deployment and analysis
* End-to-end workflows
