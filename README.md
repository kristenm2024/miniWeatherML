# miniWeatherML

Welcome to miniWeatherML: A playground for learning and developing Machine Learning (ML) surrogate models and workflows. It is based on a simplified weather model simulating flows such as [supercells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercell) that are realistic enough to be challenging and simple enough for rapid prototyping in:
* Data generation and curation
* Machine Learning model training
* ML model deployment and analysis
* End-to-end workflows

The core infrastructure of `miniWeatherML` is less than 1K lines of code, and the minimal meaningful module set is comprised of less than 3K lines of code, very little of which needs to be understood in full detail in order to effectively use `miniWeatherML` for its intended purposes.
